# Don't tick individual NPCs anymore;

## Status

Self-Approved

## Context

Currently there is a mechanism in place to tick individual NPCs, which allows for more granular control over their actions and states. However, because the population increases exponentially, having each NPC tick slows the sim down to a crawl.

## Decision

I will remove the individual ticks off of NPCs.  Instead of ticking each NPC, and then doing RNG for each of their traits and actions, I will just do RNG and randomize the results across a random sampling of the population.  EG...  There's a 0.001% chance of getting a given trait, just randomly sample 0.001% of the population.
