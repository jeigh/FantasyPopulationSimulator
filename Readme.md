# Fantasy Population Simulator

Fantasy Population Simulator is a tool designed to simulate the growth, decline, and interactions of populations in a fantasy world. It provides a framework for creating dynamic and evolving societies with customizable parameters.

I also want to explore factions within this project.   A faction can be represented by one of the following four types:  Culture, Religion, Race or Language.  I'm no sociologist, but I assume they should be based on nature/nurture.

* Race (nature) - There may be built-in biases between different races.  The common enmity between orcs and dwarves is a good example of this.

* Culture (nurture) - Some cultures have practices that are different than others, leading to enmity (or friendship) between them.

* Religion (nurture) - This is an obvious source of enmity between factions both IRL and in fantasy settings.   Some religions are violent and hostile toward other religions.

* Language (nurture) - Because culture and Language tend to pair together, I'm uncertain about adding this one.   Again, i'm no sociologist, but I suspect that it may be redundant to track lanugage and culture independently, but I'm keeping my mind open.

I eventually want to make Cultures, Religions, and Languages dynamic, so that even though I might feed a builtin set of cultures, religions and languages into the system, they should evolve over time.  Presently I intend for this to be using an algorithm, but am open to using deep learning in the distant future if the outcomes from hard-coded behavior aren's satisfying.

As part of making them dynamic, I assume I'll eventually have to create a vector database of each faction's traits.   I can then have the AI generate new factions based on existing ones. 

This project is a work in progress and is not yet fully functional. It is intended for educational purposes and as a personal project to explore population dynamics in a fantasy setting.

My inspirtaions for this project were from the game series Crusader Kings by paradox, and Everquest.   It frustrates me that the population density of mobs in everquest were not dynamic, and that they were always staying in the same zone, never evolving.
